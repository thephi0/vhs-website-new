Here are some common geyser problems and how {' '} <a href='https://vijayhomeservices.com/services/geyser-repairing-in-bangalore' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>geyser repairing In Jakkasandra, Bangalore</a>{''} can resolve them:</p>,
        "1. No Hot Water or Inconsistent Heating",
        "This is perhaps the most common issue that homeowners face. If your geyser is not heating water properly or is taking longer than usual, it could be due to a faulty thermostat, a damaged heating element, or electrical issues.",
        "• Solution: The technicians at Vijay Home Service can quickly diagnose whether the problem lies in the thermostat, the heating coil, or other internal components. They replace faulty parts with genuine spares to restore your geyser’s heating efficiency.",
        "2. Water Leakage",

        "• Solution: Vijay Home Service’s experts thoroughly inspect your geyser to identify the source of the leak. They repair or replace defective components to stop leaks and prevent further damage to your appliance and walls.",
        "3. Strange Noises from the Geyser",
        "If your geyser is making unusual noises, like popping or hissing sounds, it could be due to sediment buildup in the tank. This reduces the efficiency of the heating element and can cause the geyser to overheat.",
        "• Solution: The professionals at Vijay Home Service can descale your geyser, removing sediment and mineral deposits to improve its performance and lifespan.",
        "4. Overheating or Excessively Hot Water",

        "• Solution: Technicians can recalibrate or replace the thermostat, ensuring the water temperature remains within safe limits.",
        "5. Tripping Circuit Breaker",
